## VanillaJs

Here i used only vanilla js to create this project.there are 3 files (html,css,js).
First i bult the html and css (following figma) then i started to write js code.

## React

I also created this project using react.for me it was easier to create this project using react.
First i created the components and then i started to write js code.
I split my whole project into 6 components.Here i also used tailwindcss.I did not use any other library or framework.
